# Face-Detection-using-MTCNN

### README

#### Face Detection using MTCNN

This project demonstrates how to detect faces in an image using the MTCNN (Multi-Task Cascaded Convolutional Neural Network) model. It utilizes the MTCNN library along with other essential Python libraries such as Pillow, Matplotlib, and NumPy for image processing and visualization.

#### Prerequisites

Make sure you have Python installed on your system along with the necessary libraries:
- mtcnn
- pillow
- matplotlib
- numpy

You can install the required libraries using pip:

```
pip install mtcnn pillow matplotlib numpy
```

#### Usage

1. Clone the repository or download the code files.
2. Ensure you have an image file named "image_1.jpg" in the same directory as the code.
3. Run the code using a Python interpreter.
4. The code will detect faces in the image and display the image with bounding boxes around the detected faces.

#### Features

- Loads an image file and converts it to a NumPy array.
- Utilizes the MTCNN model to detect faces in the image.
- Draws bounding boxes around the detected faces using Matplotlib.
- Displays the image with bounding boxes to visualize the detected faces.
